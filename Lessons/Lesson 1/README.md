The script was prepared for immediate use in Space Engineers. If you're using Visual Studio with MDK make sure you **DO NOT** replace the entire code MDK generates for you with this code. Be careful to *only* replace Program(), Save() and Main() methods and not any code surrounding it otherwise MDK will not work properly.
